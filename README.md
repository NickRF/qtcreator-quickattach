Quick Attach Plugin
===================

Simple plugin for QtCreator that adds an "Attach to {target}" entry to the tools menu (where {target} is the build target of the current startup project).

When selected, the plugin will try to find a running instance of {target} and attach to it.

Last updated for Qt 5.12.8 / QtCreator v4.12.0-rc1.
